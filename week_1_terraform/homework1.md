# Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2023 Cohort

## Week 1 Homework

In this homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP install Terraform. Copy the files from the course repo
[here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/terraform) to your VM.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.

## Question 1. Creating Resources

After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Paste the output of this command into the homework submission form.

## :thumbsup: Answer to the question 1

Below the output of the command `terraform apply`.

```txt
var.project
  Your GCP Project ID

  Enter a value: hopeful-summer-375416


Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.dataset will be created
  + resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "dataset" {

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

google_bigquery_dataset.dataset: Creating...
